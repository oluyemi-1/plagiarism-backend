I write to give you formal notice that the existing arrangement permitting your occupation of the premises at [Insert full premises address] shall come to an end.

The fixed-term licence agreement dated [insert original agreement date], which expired on 24 May 2024, was not renewed. Notwithstanding its expiry, you have continued in occupation and have been paying rent on a monthly basis, due on the 24th day of each month. In the absence of a renewed agreement, your continued occupation has proceeded by way of a monthly periodic licence, terminable by the Licensor on giving reasonable notice.

Accordingly, and in line with the applicable notice period, I hereby give you one calendar monthâ€™s notice to vacate and deliver up possession of the premises. You are therefore required to vacate the property on or before 24 July 2025.

You are also reminded that payment for the monthly licence fee due on 24 May 2025 remains outstanding. Kindly ensure this sum is paid in full no later than 24 July 2025, failing which we reserve all rights in respect of recovery, including but not limited to interest and legal costs.

Should you have left the premises and cleared your effects prior to that date, you are required to return all keys and access fobs to the address above or to a representative appointed on our behalf.

Please regard this letter as formal notice to quit. No waiver of rights is intended, and this notice is served without prejudice to our entitlement to pursue any other remedies available.
